# Weather Dashboard

This is a project completed as part of The Jump Software Development Bootcamp. The project was to learn about using a 3rd party API, AJAX and making a web based project using vanilla JavaScript.

The project allows the user to search or auto detect their location. The weather from their location is displayed, a forecast for the next 4 days. From the data from the API weather tips are generated and future weather conditions.

The user can save locations which are stored in local storage.
